In this paper, we explored the possibility of applying backlight
scaling technique for real-time communication on the mobile devices,
and proposed the LCD-GDP to reduce the power consumption during the
video calls. We identified the challenges of efficiently migrating the
computation intensive tasks from offline to online. In order to scan
each frame for generating luminance histogram only once, we located
the scanning module at sender side and piggybacked this luminance
information in duplicated way. We also used a greedy algorithm to
replace the commonly applied dynamic programming technique. This would
not introduce significant latency into the communication. Finally, we
take advantage of the GPU to compensate the pixel luminance in an
timely manner. We built our LCD-GDP based on the WebRTC implementation
of chrome and evaluate it as an Anroid app. From the evaluation, upto
$33\%$ power consumption is saved on average by using our LCD-GDP. At
the same time, the quality of services in fps and latency stay in the
same level as the original real-time streaming. Little distortion in
PSNR and SSIM is found in the LCD-GDP.
