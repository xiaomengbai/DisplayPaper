\section{Introduction}

% stress the importance real-time communication on mobile devices
% This part is redundant, make it concise.
% Don't discuss the details of WebRTC. Only mention the general idea
% of Real-time communication.

The great success of the real-time communication has been witnessed in
the last decade. The real-time communication, as a considerably
cheaper alternative to the telephones, makes QQ, Skype, Apple's
Facetime and etc. so popular all round the world. More attractively,
with the bandwidth growth of the Internet, the real-time communication
is always equipped with the video channel so that two ends can talk
face-to-face. Now the prosperity of mobile devices, including
smartphones, tablets and emerging wearable devices, offers another
available platform for the real-time communication. The real-time
communication is more desired on these portable devices, which can
benefit from the wireless networks everywhere. However, new challenges
to deliver video stream on the mobile devices have raised and one of
them is to maximize the power savings.
%% On the other hand, Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over
%% HTTP(DASH) makes a salient example that how multimedia streaming is
%% delivered nowadays. WebRTC(Web Real-Time Communication), technique
%% that integrating real-time communication over HTTP, is standardized by
%% W3C and the IETF. Thus a cross-platform solution will be handy and the
%% growth of real-time communication on new platform is
%% expected.
%% As an advanced functionality, video call becomes an essential
%% component in many *communication applications/wechat, skype... check
%% in twin cloud paper*. The needs for unifying the interface is
%% increasingly desirable. The success of DATH *add name* hints people
%% the importance of HTTP in video/audio streaming scenarios. WebRTC as a
%% new API existing in HTML5 drops in developer's sight. Mainstream
%% browsers integrates the function into there production, i.e. Chrome,
%% Opera, Firefox. Developers can easily include video call in their page
%% via few lines of javascript code.

The real-time communication services will be more attractive to the
mobile users if its power consumption is cut down. During the video
playback, about 38\% to 68\% of total power is consumed by the display
subsystem, and this portion is expected to ever grow on the new
generation of devices, which are equipped with more powerful GPUs and
more large-sized display panels. In this paper, we are about to
propose a scheme to help reduce the power consumption of
Liquid-Crystal Displays(LCD), which is dominant in current transparent
display market.


In this paper, we explored the possibility if an effective LCD
power-saving technique, named luminance compensation, can be applied
on the real-time communication services. There are three steps in this
technique. 1) Extract the luminance histrogram of the frames. 2)
Decide the backlight levels and do scaling when the frames are
rendered. 3) According to the backlight levels, enhance the luminance
component of the pixels. This technique has been successfully adopted
on some other streaming services, however, there are still 
several challenges in the real-time case:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    {
      Unlike the other streaming services of predefined content, in
      real-time communication, there is no way to build a utility to
      extract and analyze the videos in the offline manner. The extraction
      process, which is computation intensive, has to be installed
      along with the services. 
    }
  \item
    {
      In a N-party communication, $N$ frames are rendered on one screen
      at the same time. $N$ times the input data makes the extraction
      operation even worse.
    }
  \item
    {
      To decide the backlights levels, a dynamic programming algorithm
      has been proposed. However, this handy soloution requires large
      buffer size to collect enough luminance information and then to
      reach the global optimal result. However, this is not practical
      in the real-time case.
    }

%%   Module}. These components are integrated into real-time
%% communication.

%% On the other hand, people doesn't satisfy themselves with traditional
%% phone call, which make them only listen to their relatives. On
%% smartphone, installing communication applications becomes available
%% and people can also see the other end over one call. *not only on the
%% traditional PC*. Moreover, video call is much cheaper, sometimes even
%% free. In the future day, we can easily make video call over webRTC,
%% the unifying interface in browsers. Since both on the mobile and PC we
%% can access it via browsers. Even more, Google has been making effort
%% on packaging their implementation in Chrome as available for Android
%% App developers. So we can make such call via the simple thing.

%% The power-saving scheme for VoIP is few, since the most applications
%% are properties of company. Researchers is hard to figure out which
%% part is enable to save the energy. Also the old applications are
%% designed for PC client. The achievement is in the network layer,
%% adapting the transmission protocols to specific scenarios *I guess,
%% check it*. On the other hand, many effective energy effective schemes
%% were proposed for streaming on mobile platform, such as *give some
%% example, ref to our paper*. This motivate us to put these schemes in
%% the real-time multimedia case.

%% Thanks to Google, the Chromes is an open source project, in the nature
%% of things the WebRTC is part of it as libjingle*introduce to
%% libjingle*. More fortunately, the libjingle is able to be integrated
%% as 3rd library with Android applications. So the Android application
%% can take advantage of this aside web browsers.

%% Display is the most great part of mobile power consuming. As
%% LCD*introduce the LCD?*, one 
%% efficient way to save power is adjust the backlight with compensating
%% the pixels. there are works done on the local video case and online
%% streaming case. Usually the GPU is used to dynamically scan frames and
%% retrieve the highest pixels. we have some opportunities:
%% \begin{itemize}
%%   \item
%%     {
%%       % Challenge: Cooperation
%%       In the real-time case, or the p2p case, video is generated via
%%       clients. We don't need to passively accept the frame and parse
%%       frames until them are decoded. On the other hand, we can scan
%%       the frames before encoding when the stream is
%%       generated. How can we effectively do this? one challenge is how
%%       we pass the information to the other side. we
%%       don't need to open another data channel on this. put the max
%%       pixel at the corner.
%%       *We can also split the scanning process*
%%       we offload the DP part to the receiver.
%%     }
%%   \item
%%     {
%%       % Challenge: take advantage of the scenarios
%%       Also the real-time communication has its characteristics. The
%%       frames staying relative still. We can adjust the max liminance
%%       in greedy manner. More aggressively, we can adjust the frames
%%       in case of skipping some frames. 
%%     }
%%   \item
%%     {
%%       % Challenge: graphical composition
%%       The receiver is asked to compose frames received from several
%%       senders. 
%%     }
%%   \item
%%     {
%%       % The DP problem
%%       The DP is not optimal if the power-backlight is not linear
%%       relationship. But the Greedy is even more not optimal.

%%       In real-communication users is more likely to be tolerant.
