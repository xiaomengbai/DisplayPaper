  Power saving is a significant issue at the mobile platform. Various
  techniques were proposed to extend the playback time of the
  videos. Backlight scaling is one of them and target the display
  subsystem. However, the multimedia content need to be delivered in a
  timely manner in the real-time communication. This raises challenges
  towards the existing backlight scaling technique. The backlight
  scaling technique is composed of computation intensive tasks,
  including the luminance histogram generation and the pixels
  luminance compensation on every frame. Multiple streaming sources in
  the video conference make this problem more difficult. Moreover,
  global luminance information is necessary for finding the optimal
  backlight levels across the streaming. This is clearly impossible in
  the real-time case. In this paper, we propose a greedy algorithm
  determining the backlight level of current frame only from the last
  one. We also take advantage of the GPU to relive the burden of the
  CPU on compensating the luminance of pixels. We integrate our
  prototype in the AppRTC, an Android app based on WebRTC, and find
  that our scheme can save up to 39.8\% energy during one
  communication session.
